This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python related to exception handling. The `function_with_uncommon_bug` function handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions, but it silently returns `None` instead of raising an exception or providing clear indication of failure. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues, especially in more complex programs. The solution provides a more robust approach using custom exceptions for better error handling and clarity.
